                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website privacy policy page. This privacy policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your personal information when you visit my website and use my services. By accessing this website, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>
                    <h2>Use Of hCaptcha</h2>
                    <p>I use the hCaptcha security service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on my website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether user actions on my online service (such as submitting a login or contact form) meet security requirements. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge.</p>
                    <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR: the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the website visitor is party (for example, the website terms) or in order to take steps at the request of the website visitor prior to entering into a contract. My online service (including my website, mobile apps, and any other apps or other forms of access offered by me) needs to ensure that it is interacting with a human, not a bot, and that activities performed by the user are not related to fraud or abuse. In addition, processing may also be based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR: my online service has a legitimate interest in protecting the service from abusive automated crawling, spam, and other forms of abuse that can harm the service or other users of the service.</p>
                    <p>IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
                    <p>For more information about hCaptcha’s privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: 
                        <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hCaptcha Privacy Policy</a> and

                    </p>
                    <h2>Use Of Web3Forms</h2>
                    <p>In addition to hCaptcha, my website uses Web3Forms to handle form submissions. When you submit a form on my website, the data you provide (such as your name, email address, and message) is sent to Web3Forms and then forwarded to my email.</p>
                    <p>Web3Forms processes the data in accordance with their privacy policy and terms of service. This includes using security measures to protect your data and ensuring compliance with relevant data protection laws.</p>
                    <p>For more information about how Web3Forms handles your data, please visit the following links: 
                        <a href="https://web3forms.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web3Forms Privacy Policy</a> and

                    <h2>Cookies</h2>
                    <p>My website utilizes cookies to enhance user experience. By accessing this website, you consent to the use of cookies as outlined in this privacy policy. Cookies, which are small data files stored on your device, are employed for specific purposes on my site. These include facilitating dark mode preferences and enhancing security for form submissions. While some cookies are essential for the website's functionality, others serve these specific functions to improve user experience and ensure data security.</p>
                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>I take the security of your personal information seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
                    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information that I hold. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact me.</p>
                    <h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>I may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or applicable laws. I will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>
