I would like to acknowledge the assistance I received in enhancing the functionality of the image slider, show more accordion, smooth scroll for compatibility across all browsers, the SVG animation on the landing page, and the contact form label animation. Implementing these features posed a challenge, and I am thankful for the guidance offered by ChatGPT. The code snippets and explanations provided by ChatGPT played a crucial role in helping me navigate and overcome the obstacles I faced.

### Additional Acknowledgments

Additionally, I'd like to acknowledge personal circumstances affecting the project's timeline. I was away on holiday for one week. I was also working 40 hours a week and looking for a new job, when I started the new job, the commute to work was longer and I had less time to complete the website. Despite challenges, I persevered to complete the website. Thank you for your understanding.
